# omicron_rbd_simulation
RBD/ACE2 complex stability comparison (Omicron vs Wild type)

Two simulation trajectories (each 500 ns) for the Omicron variant and the Original strain (i.e., wild type).

The data are in Gromacs (GRO and XTC) format.

Only the proteins were kept to compress the data.

Note: the **Q493R** is in the Omicron mutant; we used an earlier version, where **Q493K** was taken as part of the mutation in these simulations.
