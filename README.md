# Contents:

Two simulation trajectories (each 500 ns) for the _Omicron variant_ and the _Original strain_ (i.e., wild type).

The data are in Gromacs (GRO and XTC) format.

Only protein molecules were kept to compress the data. Contact us if you need the data with solvent molecules.

Note: the **Q493R** is in the Omicron mutant; we used an earlier version, where **Q493K** was taken as part of the mutation in these simulations.
